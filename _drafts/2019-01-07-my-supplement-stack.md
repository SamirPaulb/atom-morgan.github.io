Chances are you didn't know me growing up but if you did, you'd know I was never known as a jock. I was chubby for most of junior high and part of high school until I joined drumline and lost some weight. I still wasn't a physical ideal for most people but at least I wasn't chubby.

Today, it's the complete opposite. I have random people in the gym approach me to give me complimentsâ€”men and women. It turns out when you can do [cool](https://www.instagram.com/p/Br_UYhAFF8r/) [shit](https://www.instagram.com/p/Brx13OSl3tL/) people notice and they start asking you questions. You look like you know what the hell you're doing so they trust you as an authority figure.

One of the most common questions I get is, "What supplements do you take?" Honestly it's the least important part of what I do. When I quit my job to work on [my book](https://www.theangulartutorial.org/) full-time, supplements were one of the first expenses I cut. It's kind of in the name you know? *Supplements*. They're not *essentialments*.

But since I get asked this so often I figured I'd automate my response through a blog post. So below you'll find my "supplement stack" with a brief description of their importance and links to a few products that I have *personally bought and used with my own money*. No sponsorships or anything like that. Maybe one day!

The supplements will also be broken down into two categories: day-to-day and nice-to-haves. If there are some pricier supplements, you'll also find the cheaper alternatives I used while I was unemployed (As much as I love [Onnit](https://www.onnit.com/supplements/), I just couldn't justify the price!). But once again, some of them I just chose not to use during that time because once again, they're supplements. The most important part of my health and fitness habit is that I was working out or going to the gym 5-7 days a week.

## Day to day

#### Vitamin D3

Why: Nobody is getting enough sun exposure, especially if you're a programmer. We sit inside all day typing away at keyboards and we're missing out on this essential vitamin. 70% deficiency. Increased aging, risk of muscle and bone pain, type 1 diabetes, breast, colon, ovary, esophagus, and prostate cancer.

#### Cod liver oil

Why: High in omega-3 fatty acids which reduce inflammation and lower blood pressure. Similar to Vitamin D3, we don't get enough of it. Cod liver oil gives you 113% of your recommended daily intake. It also gives you vitamin A which maintains healthy eyes, brain function, and skin. Cod liver oil gives you 90% of your RDI.

#### GABA

Why: GABA is what's referred to as your body's "calm down" signal. When you're anxious, neurons release GABA to chill everything out. Sleep, gut health, brain function.
