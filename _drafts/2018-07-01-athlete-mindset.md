title: Treat Your Craft Like an Athlete
---

If I'm serious about learning any skill in life I find the best way to keep myself in check to ensure I *really* want it is to treat myself like an athlete.

Athletes are peak performers and not just in a physical way. I'm referring to their ability to focus in on a goal and work extremely hard towards that goal. It's a part of their everyday life.

Whether I'm learning how to code or learning how to play a musical instrument, there's no reason I shouldn't approach that task as if I'm an athlete. Would LeBron James say, "I'm tired. Writing code can wait until tomorrow"? Everyone has their off days but the norm, to get to a level like LeBron James, revolves entirely around their craft. Why should coding be any different?

Mike Tyson, one of the greatest boxers to ever live, lived and breathed boxing. If he wasn't sparring or training he was watching fight films. A body has its limits so in between the physical training, he was perfecting his craft by watching the greats before him. He became a student of his craft in every way possible.

Imagine Tyson trying to become the greatest boxer ever if he focused only on his physical training. I'm sure he would have done well but would he have been as good? Would his game be the same without studying other boxers to see how some won and others lost?

The same can apply to any other craft. Learning how to code doesn't imply that you have to be sitting in front of a computer typing away. If you don't feel like coding, why not watch a tech talk or live coding stream instead? Watching other people code and thinking out loud will provide a benefit to you even if it isn't in the form of a commit on GitHub.

You'll see different ways of solving a problem you've worked through yourself. You'll see different design patterns or features within other frameworks and libraries. Test driven development may seem difficult to do until you find that *one person* who explains it so well that your entire approach to coding was changed without typing a single line of code.

Athletes also understand the importance of focusing on the long-term. If LeBron decides to practice his 3-point shot today, does he honestly expect that tomorrow he will wake up with a noticeable improvement? Of course not. But he knows that consistent and focused practice towards that goal will inevitably lead to improvement at some later point in time.

An intellectual pursuit like coding is no different. You'll stumble upon [promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) today and it'll make very little sense. Don't stop there. Read more about promises tomorrow. Watch a YouTube tutorial about them the next day. Search for "promises" on StackOverflow to see if any explanations there make sense. Eventually the bits and pieces will start to come together. Don't let a misunderstanding today deter you from trying again tomorrow.

Nobody likes to suck but we all have to start somewhere.

Ask yourself, "Do I genuinely not like coding or do I just hate sucking at coding?" If you genuinely don't like it, that's fine. Move on to something else.

If you like coding and hate sucking embrace it and know that if you continue to work at what you suck at, eventually you'll get better.
