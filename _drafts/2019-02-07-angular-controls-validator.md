## Introduction

## Setup

If you haven't already, you'll first need to install the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/).

```console
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Once the CLI is installed, you can then create a new application.

```console
ng new reactive-forms
cd reactive-forms
```

Once your application has been created, you can run the application.

```console
ng serve
```

Open a browser to `http://localhost:4200` and you should see the default Angular application as shown below.
